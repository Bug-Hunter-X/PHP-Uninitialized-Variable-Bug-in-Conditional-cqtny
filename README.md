# PHP Uninitialized Variable Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: using an uninitialized variable in a conditional statement.  The `bug.php` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.php` provides the corrected version.

The bug arises from accessing the `$result` variable within the `if` condition before it's been reliably assigned a value. If an exception is thrown within the `try` block, `$result` remains undefined, resulting in an error or unpredictable behavior.

The solution ensures `$result` is always initialized, handling both successful and exceptional cases.
